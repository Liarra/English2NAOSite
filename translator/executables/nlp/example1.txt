The scenario starts with the robot saying “hi <name child>” and providing a hand at the same time. When the child shakes the hand of the robot, this is rewarded by saying “thank you” (press y) and the robot shaking the hand of the child (natural reward) . However, when the child does not show appropriate behavior, I want to provide prompts (press n), e.g. levels of help to the child. There are 4 levels of prompts: wait prompt (wait(700)), open question prompt (say(what_can_you_say_to_me_now)), supplement/fill-in prompt (say(fill_in)&wait(500)&say(hi_ro…)), tell prompt(say(say_after_me)&wait(500)&say(hi_robot)). These prompts are differing from least to most help, and the sequence is different for each child. By clicks on buttons, I can provide prompts with the interface or I can use the text-to-speech option when I want to use other prompts. When the child shows no appropriate response after the first prompt, a second, third and forth prompt are provided. When the child does not respond to prompts of the robot, I will help the child as a therapist by providing the prompts myself or say it together with the child. When the child shows appropriate behaviour after the 
prompts, the reward is provided.
